# Sudoku-Solver
Implementation of an object-oriented system for solving a sudoku board at an easy difficulty level

In order to build a solver for the Sudoku game, we will divide the problem into three parts. Each part will form a class. The departments are Cell,
SubGrid, Grid, representing a single cell, an inner square, and the board itself, respectively.

cell class have 3 fields:
i - holds the row index in the inner square where the cell is located, 0‚â§ùëñ‚â§2.
j - holds the column index in the inner square where the cell is located, 0‚â§ùëó‚â§2.
values - holds a list of possible cell values (the values will be between 1 and 9).


subGrid class represents an inner square on the sudoku board. This class has 3 fields:
The field i - represents the number of the square (according to the numbering in the picture at the beginning of the question (0‚â§ùëñ‚â§8).
The grid field - a list of 3x3 lists, with each cell holding a Cell type object. Cell Type Object with
Indexes i, j will be held in a grid matrix at position i, j.
The field collected_values - a list of cell values that have already been placed in an internal square (initial values ‚Äã‚Äãor values ‚Äã‚Äãthat have already been
We have found (so far in an inner square numbered i.
For example, for square number 5 in the following table:

The values will be:
i = 5
grid = [[Cell(0, 0), Cell(0, 1), Cell(0, 2, 3)],
[Cell(1, 0), Cell(1, 1), Cell(1, 2, 1)],
[Cell(2, 0), Cell(2, 1), Cell(2, 2, 6),]]
collected_values = [3, 1, 6] (doesn‚Äôt have to be in this order)

Grid class represents the Sudoku game board in its entirety. The department has 3 fields:
The sub_grids field - a list of 9 lengths, which holds all the inner squares of the board. The cell in position i will be an object
Of the SubGrid type numbered i.
The rows field - a list containing 9 internal lists of numbers, where the internal list in position i will contain all the values
We have so far solved in line number i.
The columns field - a list that contains 9 internal lists of numbers, where the internal list in position i will contain all
The values we have solved so far in column number i.
